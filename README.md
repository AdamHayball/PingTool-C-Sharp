# PingTool-C-Sharp
Simple Ping Tool in C#

This is an experimental project to see how complex and how well the Free Research Preview of ChatGPT-3.5 can create a program. The original Idea was to have it write a simple script file that takes two IP addresses and pings them concurrently 200 times with the windows native ping tool in command line.

This version is a continuation of the powershell script attempt utilizing C# .NET framework and Visual Studio Community Edition as suggested by ChatGPT.
