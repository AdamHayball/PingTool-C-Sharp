<h1>Simple Ping Tool in C#</h1>
    
    <p>This project serves as an experiment, designed to gauge the complexity and proficiency of ChatGPT-3.5's Free Research Preview in creating programs. Initially, the idea was to have the model generate a basic script that would perform concurrent pinging of two IP addresses, executing this task 200 times using the native Windows ping tool in the command line.</p>

    <p>The current version represents a continuation of the effort, building upon the initial attempt using a powershell script. Now, the project is evolving to leverage the C# .NET framework and Visual Studio Community Edition, guided by the insights from ChatGPT.</p>

    <p>Throughout this pursuit of a ChatGPT-generated application, certain insights have emerged. OpenAI deliberately enforces limits on response length, affecting the overall capacity for code revision. When presented with a substantial project, ChatGPT may decline, essentially communicating that the task is extensive and beyond its capability. However, when provided with smaller, individual tasks, its success rate tends to be higher. This limitation can be likened to expecting a single programmer to complete an entire project within a mere 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>The clarity of the initial "prompt" significantly influences the achievement of desired outcomes. In cases where build errors arise, ChatGPT can resolve these issues when provided with the error details and the modified code for review. Occasionally, ChatGPT may be ambiguous regarding the appropriate location for inserting a code revision snippet. To address this, it's recommended to share the entire code and request a complete updated version in response, rather than just a snippet. So far, ChatGPT has demonstrated performance on par with, or even surpassing, human outsourcing solutions like Fiverr when it comes to program development.</p>

    <p>In some instances, human intervention was necessary to help ChatGPT identify conflicts within the code and their resolutions. In the current stage of development, ChatGPT plays more of a supportive role than that of the primary coder.</p>

    <p>Revisions can prove challenging, as ChatGPT may disregard existing solutions in longer projects and introduce conflicting code, leading to redundancy issues that require human intervention to correct.</p>

    <p>When attempting to introduce significant functional changes, ChatGPT may struggle to understand why it can't seamlessly add new methods and achieve the desired functionality.</p>

    <p>While endeavoring to incorporate IPV6 support, it became evident that a comprehensive code overhaul, along with the integration of new libraries and extensive debugging, would be necessary.</p>

    <p>The outcomes generated by ChatGPT can appear inconsistent, as its style and approach may vary frequently. Utilizing a new chat session can yield either positive or negative results, depending on the logical state of the language model at that moment.</p>

    <p>Barring any major bugs or feature changes, the development of this program is nearing completion, as the program is now fully functional and in regular use.</p>

    <p>By the way, I had ChatGPT revise the README â€“ quite amusing! XD</p>
